# BIOTEC Files for ESCAPE-GAME

All these points describe how to set up and use the BIOTEC Escape Game files. 
These several codes here are those updated and to use for each sessions.

## FAKE_BOMB (SAAM)

The fake bomb is the central element of the Escape Game (SAAM = Système Atomiseur Aérosol de Motiviation). 
It represents the system triggered at the start of the escape game, but also the one that will be defused at the end.

## MINITEL
The minitel is the main piece of equipment for test 4. The entire section describes how to set up, launch and use the database.


### COUNTDOWN_LED
The set-up allows you to count down with LEDs for the duration of the escape game. Accessible via a Web GUI, it lets players know how much time is left and puts the pressure on them.
